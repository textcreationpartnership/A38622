#####Body#####

1. AN ESSAY Concerning ADEPTS. In Two PARTS.

    _ The firſt Part.

      * 1. Section. That it cannot reaſonably be denied, that there is ſuch a thing as the Philoſophers Stone.

      * II. Sect. That it would be a mighty Advantage, to enjoy the benefits of the Philoſophers Stone.

      * III. Sect. That Adepts ſay, It is no very difficult matter to obtain their Ineſtimable Treaſure.

      * IV. Sect. That Adepts are diſcouraged from communicating themſelves, or their Medecine, as they otherwiſe would.

      * V. Sect. What would encourage Adepts to communicate themſelves more, or what would put them in a capacity to be beneficial to Men.

      * VI: Sect. The inexcuſableneſs and folly of rejecting the Beefits which would accrue to the World, if things were ſo diſpoſed that Adepts were encouraged in ſome meaſure to communicate themſelves, and were put in a capacity to be Beneficial to Men.

      * I. Section. The Occaſion of this Second Part.

      * II. Sect. An Explication of theſe words, It is thought, Adepts wiſh that Chriſtians would live ſomewhat after the manner of the Lacedemonians.

      * Sect. III. How it would be poſſible for Chriſtian's to live much after that manner.

      * Sect. IV. That undoubtedly it would be moſt reaſonable and moſt Chriſtian like to follow that ſort of Life.

      * Sect. V. That yet Adepts cannot be thought to require expreſly ſo much, for if they pleaſed, they might eaſily reduce Men to an abſolute neceſſity to do ſo.

      * Sect. VI. That in general, they would undoubtedly require of men nothing but Secrecy and Fidelity, Reaſon and Moderation, Juſtice and Mercifulneſs; and that 'tis not to be doubted, could they be aſſured of theſe, they would be ready to communicate themſelves, under ſome juſt limitations.

      * Sect. VII. What this Condition, more particularly, may be ſuppoſed, for inſtance, to Imply.

      * Sect. VIII. The Aſſurance which has been intimated that Princes might give.

      * Sect. IX. What Great men might reaſonably do, in order to obtain the Elixir
